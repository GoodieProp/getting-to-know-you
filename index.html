        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello! My Name is Xavier Gonzalez. I am 21 years old. I am majoring in Computer Science,
            and have a concentration in Cyber Security Operations. I am pursuing Computer Science
            because I've always been interested in technology since before high school. It started
            off as a hobby. I would code on Runescape Private Servers open source, which is built
            on Java. I would self-teach myself Java and other programming languages such as C, C++
            and Python. 
            <br><br>
            I was born in the US, however I am also <a href="https://colombia.travel/en" target="_blank">Colombian</a>
            and <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/brazil/the-northeast/salvador" target="_blank">Salvadorian</a>. 
            My father is Colombian, while my mother is Salvadorian. I lived in Colombia for 6 years 
            (4th - 10th grade) and it was a blast. I was able to connect with my culture there, and 
            able to further advance my spanish speaking there. I am currently fluent in both Spanish and English. 
        </p>

        <h4>My Favorite Hobby</h4>
        <p>My Favorite Hobby is playing Video Games. I've been playing video games since I was kid.
            My first game console was the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-nz/explore/ps1/" target="_blank">PlayStation 1</a>.
            I would play either Spiderman or Scooby Doo, which I completed both in a couple months. Playing
            games has always motivated me to do better and I also became more competitive. I have an Xbox One,
            but I recently bought a gaming laptop which has allowed me to have access to a more diverse
            marketplace for games.

        <h6>Fun Fact!</h6>
        <p>I have a nickname people call me which is X, short for Xavier. It started when I was in high school back in the US.
            I just started school and I went for the Soccer team tryouts. The coach said my name was too long
            and decided to call me X from that point forward. After that, everyone in school, including my teachers,
            dean, and principle, all called me X. So if it's easier to remember me as X instead of Xavier, go for it!
